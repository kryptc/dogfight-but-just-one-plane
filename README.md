Welcome to DOGFIGHT BUT JUST ONE PLANE, a fighter jet simulator game. The aim of the game is to navigate through hostile territories with deadly volcanoes, enemy paratroopers and heat seeking missiles while destroying all enemy outposts and getting more points. The plane is modelled after an F-16 Fighting Falcon, but very rudimentarily through OpenGL.

*Controls:*
-`W` - Thrust i.e. increase speed of plane
-`A` - Yaw left
-`D` - Yaw right
-`Q` - Roll left
-`E` - Roll right
-`SPACEBAR` - Increase height
-`S` - Decrease height
-`RIGHT MOUSE CLICK` - Drop bomb
-`LEFT MOUSE CLICK` - Shoot missile
-`L` - Perform a loop-de-loop
-`B` - Perform a barrel roll
-`I` - Pitch upwards

-`RIGHT ARROW KEY` - Follow view
-`UP ARROW KEY` - Top view
-`DOWN ARROW KEY` - Helicopter view


*Rules:*
1. Don't die.
2. The red arrow points to the next enemy outpost. Drop a bomb on it to destroy it and gain points.
3. Shoot missiles at the enemy paratroopers dropping from the sky to get more points.
4. There are 2 kinds of projectiles being shot at you: Cannonballs and Heat Seekers. Cannonballs are shot at arbitrary angles and Heat Seekers are shot at your current location. You lose points and fuel if you get hit by either.
5. Don't stray too close to a volcano or you will die.
6. Your fuel keeps decreasing, so collect the green fuel tankers to replenish your fuel.
7. Fly through the smoke rings above ground to get more points.

*Other stuff:*
Your airplane has a dashboard which shows your current altitude, score and fuel level. There is also a compass that points to the current North direction. In helicopter view, move your mouse around to look at the plane from other directions and scroll to zoom in or zoom out.

Note: All bonuses done.
